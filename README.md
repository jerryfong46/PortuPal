# PortuPal

PortuPal is a language learning tool that leverages popular children's books to help users learn the most common words first. The goal of PortuPal is to enable users to read 70-80% of a book within a few months after learning the most common 1000-2000 words.

## Methodology

PortuPal uses a combination of techniques to aid language learning:

- **Frequency Analysis**: PortuPal analyzes children's books to find the most common words. By focusing on these words first, users can quickly gain a working vocabulary.
- **Spaced Repetition**: PortuPal uses spaced repetition algorithms to help users memorize new words. By reviewing words at increasing intervals, users can move new words from their short-term to their long-term memory more effectively.
- **Generative AI**: PortuPal uses generative AI techniques to create short stories based on learned words. This provides users with new, engaging material that's perfectly suited to their current vocabulary level.
